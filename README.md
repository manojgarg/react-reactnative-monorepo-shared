# Monorepo for react & react-native projects with shared code
A monorepo for hosting both React & React Native projects with common code 
shared across. This will maintain specific boundaries for each project separately 
making sure that we don't end up creating a monolith.

Yarn & yarn workspaces are used, scripts needed are provided below.
